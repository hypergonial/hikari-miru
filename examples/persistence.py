# If you want your components to work and persist after an application restart,
# you have to make them persistent. There are two conditions to this:
# - The view's timeout must explicitly be set to None
# - All components MUST have a unique custom_id within the view

# Tip: It is recommended to subclass components to have the ability to pass
# variable custom_ids. See the subclassed example on how to do this.

# Tip 2: To check if your view can be persistent or not, use the View.is_persistent
# boolean property.
# If this is false, calling client.start_view with bind_to=None will fail.
