- Add ``miru.get_view()`` to get a currently running view by message snowflakeish.

- Add ``ephemeral`` kwarg to ``NavigatorView`` for ephemeral support.

- Annotate ``miru.button()`` and ``miru.select()`` to return their respective objects.

- No longer use explicit submodules unless they are exported in context type signatures.

Thanks to `sadru <https://github.com/thesadru>`_ for help with this release.

Version 1.0.0
=============

- Remove ``app`` parameter from ``View``.

- Add ``miru.load()`` to load miru and pass ``app``. This replaces passing ``app`` to view, and should be called once on startup.

- Add ``Context`` and switch all item methods to use it in favour of ``Interaction``.

- Moved all short-hand methods from ``Interaction`` to ``Context``, renaming some of them. Please check the API reference for both.

- ``Interaction`` is now practically identical to ``hikari.ComponentInteraction`` with no added methods.

- Added documentation to the project

- Views are now assigned to messages, and if a new view is assigned to a message that already has one, the old one will be automatically stopped. This does not apply to unbound persistent views.
